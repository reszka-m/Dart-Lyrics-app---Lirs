## General info
It's one of our first apps, so it's no perfect - obviously. We are not advanced in various technologies and designing, therefore you can see some bugs
and not perfect design. Despite of that, i think we did good work. There are four full decoded API calls from what we used about only 20% of it's contents.
So if you would do something more with this project, go ahead!
